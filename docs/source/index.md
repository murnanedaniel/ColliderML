# Welcome to ColliderML

ColliderML is a modern machine learning library designed specifically for high-energy physics data analysis. It provides efficient tools for accessing, processing, and analyzing large-scale particle physics datasets.

## Features

- **XRootD Integration**: Efficient access to remote physics datasets
- **Data Management**: Unified interface for various HEP data formats
- **ML Tools**: Specialized machine learning utilities for particle physics
- **Visualization**: Tools for physics data visualization

## Quick Installation

```bash
pip install colliderml
```

## Basic Usage

```python
from colliderml.core.io import XRootDClient

# Initialize client
client = XRootDClient('root://eospublic.cern.ch/')

# List directory contents
files = client.list_directory('/eos/opendata/cms/Run2012B/DoubleMuParked/AOD')

# Download a file
client.download_file(
    remote_path='/eos/opendata/cms/Run2012B/DoubleMuParked/AOD/file.root',
    local_path='data/file.root'
)
```
