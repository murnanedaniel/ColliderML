# ColliderML

<AboutData>

The ColliderML dataset is the largest-yet source of full-detail simulation in a virtual detector experiment.

**Why virtual?** The simulation choices are not tied to a construction timeline, there are no budget limitations, no politics. The only goals are to produce the most realistic physics on a detailed detector geometry, with significant computating challenges, in an ML-friendly structure.

The ColliderML dataset provides comprehensive simulation data for machine learning applications in high-energy physics, with detailed detector responses and physics object reconstructions.

## Get the Data

The ColliderML datasets are hosted on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/OpenDataDetector) and can be accessed using the `datasets` library.

### Quick Start

1. Install the datasets library:
```bash
pip install datasets
```

2. Load a dataset:
```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load particles data from ttbar events (no pileup)
dataset = load_dataset("OpenDataDetector/ColliderML_ttbar_pu0", "particles")
```

### Interactive Configuration

Use the configurator below to customize your dataset selection and generate the corresponding code:
